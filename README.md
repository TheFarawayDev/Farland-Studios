### A Place Where Anyone Can Learn And Make Games And Sites!

## Welcome

If you are new here you probably don't know about the elephant in the room. No not an actual elephant but issues. As most know (except for you) I have a site called Farland Studios a site that both makes games and unblocks them. But it can be risky sometimes so you may be able to help with the site.

## Just In Case The Google Site Is Blocked!

If the site is blocked please do the following:

1. If it is blocked use this url but don't hit enter yet!
https://thefarawaydev.github.io/Farland-Studios/Farland%20Studios%20Site/Games/
2. Enter the name of the game the names will be provided in a file or below due to how case sensitve it is.
3. Enjoy the games with no google site! And it is practically unblockable until a teachers finds it! Which could take around 50 years and by then i'm long gone.
